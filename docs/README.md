# Building the NPM package

We use a Webpack[webpack] configuration for building the contents of the NPM package ready for publishing. To build the package, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will install dependencies, lint JS files, and then build the package content in the `./dist/` directory.

# Running tests

To perform the package build process above and then run front-end JS tests using Karma Test Runner[karma] and Jasmine[jasmine] against the processed files:

```
npm run test
```

# Publishing to NPM

These steps assume you have logged into the NPM CLI and are apart of the @mozmeao organization on NPM

TrafficCop is published to NPM under the `@mozmeao/trafficcop` namespace/package name. To publish a release to NPM, use the following steps:

1. Before you start make sure the project's [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] is up to date.
2. Update the package `version` number in [package.json][package.json] (use [Semantic Versioning][semver] to determine what the new version number should be).
3. Update the package README [README.md][readme].
4. Run `npm install` to update the package-lock.json file.
5. Submit a pull request with your against the `main` branch. Once the changes have been approved and merged to main:
6. Run `npm test` to run the build script and front-end tests. The package contents will be located in `./dist/`.
7. Tag a new release. You can do this either using [Git tag][git-tag], or directly on the [GitHub website][releases]. (Example: `git tag -a v1.1.0`). If you used [Git tag][git-tag], push your tags to the repo using `git push --tags`
8. If the build is successful and all tests pass, publish to NPM using `npm publish ./dist/`.
